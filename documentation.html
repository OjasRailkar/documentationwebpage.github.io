            <h1 id="HTML">HTML</h1>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
                local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
                page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and
                directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about
                document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use
                them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
            <h1 id="CSS">CSS</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
                XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
            <h1 id="BOOTSTRAP">BOOTSTRAP</h1>
            <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web
                pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply
                Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is
                whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap
                provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose,
                tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes
                defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has
                provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with
                a highlight.</p>

            <h1 id="JAVASCRIPT">JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                them.
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                additional objects; for example:

            <h1 id="SQL">SQL</h1>

            <P>
                SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

                What is SQL?
                SQL stands for Structured Query Language
                SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the
                International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
                What Can SQL do?
                SQL can execute queries against a database
                SQL can retrieve data from a database
                SQL can insert records in a database
                SQL can update records in a database
                SQL can delete records from a database
                SQL can create new databases
                SQL can create new tables in a database
                SQL can create stored procedures in a database
                SQL can create views in a database
                SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views
                SQL is a Standard - BUT....
                Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

                However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as
                SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

                Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the
                SQL standard!

                Using SQL in Your Web Site
                To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

                An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
                To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
                To use SQL to get the data you want
                To use HTML / CSS to style the page

                What is Python?
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

                It is used for:

                web development (server-side),
                software development,
                mathematics,
                system scripting.
                What can Python do?
                Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
                Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
                Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
                Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
                Why Python?
                Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
                Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
                languages.
                Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This
                means that prototyping can be very quick.
                Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
                Good to know
                The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However,
                Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
                In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly
                useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
                Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
                Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence
                from mathematics.
                Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use
                semicolons or parentheses.
                Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions
                and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

                What is Java?
                Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

                It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

                It is used for:

                Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
                Desktop applications
                Web applications
                Web servers and application servers
                Games
                Database connection
                And much, much more!
                Why Use Java?
                Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
                It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
                It has a large demand in the current job market
                It is easy to learn and simple to use
                It is open-source and free
                It is secure, fast and powerful
                It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
                Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
                reused, lowering development costs
                As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
